Good morning everyone.

In today’s digital world, data plays a crucial role in almost every decision we make. From recommending the next video we watch to helping doctors diagnose diseases, data drives intelligence across industries.

However, data by itself has no value unless it is properly collected, cleaned, and understood. Raw data often contains noise, inconsistencies, and missing information. Effective data ingestion ensures that information from multiple sources is transformed into a usable and reliable format.

As technology continues to evolve, the ability to ingest and process data efficiently will become even more important. Those who understand how to work with data will be better equipped to build intelligent systems and make informed decisions.

Thank you.
